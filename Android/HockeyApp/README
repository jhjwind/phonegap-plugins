 First attempt at creating HockeyApp Plugin

Using Eclipse 3.7
Android 2.2

Ref:
Make a PhoneGap App with http://www.phonegap.com/start#android
Add HockeyKit with http://support.hockeyapp.net/kb/client-integration/hockeyapp-for-android

Problems:
Finding out how to implement the plugin as class using HockeyKit : not the same as on iPhone :)
